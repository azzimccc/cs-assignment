# Question 1
SmartGame is a company that manufactures bikes, wheelbarrows, and firefighter cars for kids.
Each bike requires two wheels and 2 lights, and can be sold for 40$. Each wheelbarrow requires
one wheel and 2 lights, and can be sold for 30$. 
Each firefighter car requires four wheels and six lights, and can be sold for 150$. 
There are 60 wheels and 100 lights in the company storage. 
The companyâ€™s goal is to produce toys with highest potential revenue (assume that all other 
resources and materials required for manufacturing are not limited).

# Question 2
In a mastermind game, the code maker hides a secret code consisting of 4 digits, and the code 
breaker is to provide 4-digit guess codes until he gets the code right. 
The code maker gives feedback in this manner, a sink is awarded to a perfect match of a digit 
plus its position, and a hit refers to a right match of digit but in the wrong position. 
How do you devise an algorithm to provide the correct feedback? 
First, work on the special case that no digit in the code should be repeated. Then work
on the general case where digits can be duplicated.

# Question 3
Our coins come in denominations of 1 cent, 5 cents, 10 cents, 20 cents, 50 cents and 1 dollar. Assuming
that there are unlimited number of coins, how would you devise a coin-change algorithm to compute 
the minimum number of coins required to make up a particular amount? 
For example, for 46 cents you need 4 coins: two 20-cent coins, one 5-cent coin, and one 1-cent coin.
